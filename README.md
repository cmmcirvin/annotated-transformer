This repository attempts to serve as a small, bare-bones transformer implementation. This repository is intended primarily for personal learning and as a starting point for future experiments into transformer architectures and applications.

Heavily inspired by http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/, whose repository was used as a starting point.
